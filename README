StringifyDate
=============

Note: work in progress

Rails plugin to define a get and set method for dates using your own format. 

Simple example
==============

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  stringify_date :born_on, :format => :nz_format
end

Creates two methods called 'born_on_string' and 'born_on_string=' which will create, and parse date strings using the 'nz_format' as specified in ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Date::Conversions::DATE_FORMATS. This is often declared in your application.rb file.

Complex example
===============

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  stringify_date :born_on, :format => :nz_format, 
                 :stringified_name => 'birth_date', :required => true, 
                 :required_message => 'is a mandatory field',
                 :invalid_message => 'should be in the format DD/MM/YYYY'
end


Error handling
==============

Creates an error message on the stringified field if:
  - string does not parse (ie: invalid format supplied)
  - required was true, but not supplied
